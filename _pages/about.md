:czech_republic:  
I am a PhD student at [Multi-Robot Systems Lab](http://mrs.felk.cvut.cz/), Czech Technical University in Prague under the supervision of [Dr. Martin Saska](http://mrs.felk.cvut.cz/people/martin-saska), [Dr. Tiago Nascimento](http://mrs.felk.cvut.cz/members/postdocs/nascimento), and [Dr. Robert Penicka](https://mrs.felk.cvut.cz/members/postdocs/penicka). I work on control, navigation, and state-estimation for aerial vehicles (quadrotors) that are operating in collaboration with a marine vessel. Additionally, I am also working on pushing the envelope on fast and agile flights with quadrotors.

:it:  
2020 and subsequently, COVID, was spent working on co-axial octarotors at [FlyingBasket SRL](https://flyingbasket.com/) in Italy where we engineered heavy-lift (160 kg TOW) aerial vehicles to deliver cargo in the mountainous regions of Südtirol.

:us:  
I spent a year in Philadelphia at [Kumar Lab(GRASP)](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/research-groups/kumar-lab/) at the University of Pennsylvania under the guidance of [Dr. David Saldaña](http://swarmslab.com/). We worked on building the world's first modular aerial system [ModQuad]() which can reconfigure mid-air(without landing).

:india:  
I was born in Sikar, Rajasthan in India and I graduated from BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus with double majors i.e. Physics and Mechanical Engineering in an integrated dual-degree program for Bachelors and Masters(points for identifying my Masters major).

:framed_picture:  
I spend a lot of my time listening to Jazz, Classical, and Electronic music in live and recorded forms. After work, you can find me at my bouldering gym :climbing_man:, having a beer :beer:, or cooking something at home :cook:. Also found in galleries and museums gawking at paintings.
